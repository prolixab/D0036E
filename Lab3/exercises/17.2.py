# This exercise is a cautionary tale about one of the most common, and difficult to find, errors in Python.
# Write a definition for a class named Kangaroo with the following methods:
#
#     An __init__ method that initializes an attribute named pouch_contents to an empty list.
#     A method named put_in_pouch that takes an object of any type and adds it to pouch_contents.
#     A __str__ method that returns a string representation of the Kangaroo object and the contents of the pouch.
#
# Test your code by creating two Kangaroo objects, assigning them to variables named kanga and roo, and then adding roo to the contents of kangaâ€™s pouch.
